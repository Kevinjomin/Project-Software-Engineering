# Project-Software-Engineering

**To-do-list in code**

High priority :
- Test the passive selection
- Test level scaling values

Inside gameplay:
- create a list of level prefabs the level manager can select from. Each level must have player spawn point, enemy spawn, and exit (door/portal/whatever to continue to next level)

Outside gameplay:
- Make sound manager to handle music and sfx (low priority, focus on mechanics first)
