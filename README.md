# Project-Software-Engineering

**To-do-list in code**
Inside gameplay:
- make level manager (used to determine selected map, count the current level, determine enemy scaling based on current level, and setup level which includes spawning player and enemy)
- create a list of level prefabs the level manager can select from. Each level must have player spawn point, enemy spawn, and exit (door/portal/whatever to continue to next level)
- make enemy spawn (use a public list of enemy prefabs that get selected randomly on level setup)
- store player last position to spawn them back after combat

Outside gameplay:
- make shop and upgrade system
- add main menu UI (start, difficulty select, setting)
- Make sound manager to handle music and sfx

Optional:
- (low priority) make a buff/passive skill system.
