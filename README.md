**To-do-list in code**

High priority :
- Test the passive selection
- make sure passive selection work when passive left is below 3

Inside gameplay:
- make level manager determine enemy scaling based on current level
- create a list of level prefabs the level manager can select from. Each level must have player spawn point, enemy spawn, and exit (door/portal/whatever to continue to next level)

Outside gameplay:
- Make sound manager to handle music and sfx

Optional:
- (low priority) make a buff/passive skill system.
